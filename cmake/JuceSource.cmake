# Where JUCE comes from.
#
# JUCE is 94 MB of working tree AND about 290 MB of git objects, so one checkout
# is ~385 MB rather than the 94 MB `du` on the submodule directory reports --
# a submodule's objects live in .git/modules, outside the tree being measured.
# Four plugins in this ecosystem pin the same commit, so four checkouts is about
# 1.5 GB of the same files, not the 376 MB this comment used to claim.
#
# The shared checkout lives at ~/Programming/.juce/JUCE and carries the UNION of
# the ecosystem's JUCE patches, which each project applies to it idempotently at
# configure time. CHALKWALK_JUCE_DIR --
# a cache variable or an environment variable -- points at one shared checkout
# instead.
#
# Unset, nothing changes: this repository's own JUCE submodule is used and a
# fresh clone builds with no extra steps. That is deliberate. The submodule
# stays the source of truth for WHICH commit this project wants, and sharing is
# an optimisation a developer opts into, not a dependency.
#
# To use it, and free the local checkout:
#
#     cmake -B build -DCHALKWALK_JUCE_DIR=$HOME/Programming/.juce/JUCE
#     git submodule deinit JUCE          # the pin stays recorded in git
#
# THE SHARED CHECKOUT CARRIES THE UNION OF EVERY PROJECT'S JUCE PATCHES. They
# touch disjoint files today, so the union is well defined -- but it does mean
# building against patches another plugin needed. That coupling is the price of
# one checkout and it is accepted knowingly.
